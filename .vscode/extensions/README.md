# What is this?

This is a very simple Vscode extension that causes files with a `#!py` shebang to get rendered as Python.

# Usage

Vscode should prompt you to install this extension as soon as you open `bk_salt` in Vscode.

# Limitations

If you create a new file and add `#!py` as a shebang, you need to manually reload the Vscode window with `cmd + shift + p`, searching `Reload`, and hitting enter.
